General Assembly DSI Bootcamp project for New Light Tech.: Using Google Street View as a baseline for damage assessment

## Project Prompt:
**Problem 6: Using Google Street View as a baseline for damage assessment.**

*Problem Statement:* During the recovery phase immediately following a disaster, FEMA performs damage assessment “on the ground” to assess the level of damage caused to residential parcels and to critical infrastructure. To assure an accurate estimation of the damage, it is important to understand the condition of the structures prior to the event. To help and guide the damage assessment efforts following a disaster and to assist the surveyors identify the structures of interest, this tool (a web-app or a mobile app) will expect to get, as an input, a list of addresses. It will retrieve screen shots of the structures from Google Street View. The students will design a damage assessment form, which, in addition to relevant information about the level of damage to the structures, will also provide a pre-event photo of the assessed structure.
