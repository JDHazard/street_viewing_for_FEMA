    <h1>About StreetView</h1>
    <p>Team StreetView is a project run by Omar, Stevie, Will and John of DSI-7 </p>
    <p>During the recovery phase immediately following a disaster, FEMA performs
      damage assessment “on the ground” to assess the level of damage caused to
      residential parcels and to critical infrastructure. To assure an accurate
      estimation of the damage, it is important to understand the condition of
      the structures prior to the event. To help and guide the damage assessment
      efforts following a disaster and to assist the surveyors identify the
      structures of interest, this tool (a web-app or a mobile app) will expect
      to get, as an input, a list of addresses. It will retrieve screen shots
      of the structures from Google Street View. We will design a
      damage assessment form, which, in addition to relevant information
      about the level of damage to the structures, will also provide a
      pre-event photo of the assessed structure.</p>
